My name is professor Anthony Wong. I am a graduate student (and also a PhD
student). My field of study is computational engineering and systems science. I
am a guest lecturer on the Department of Industrial Engineering and has several
graduate/post doctoral courses on some topics. So please allow me to add some
useful information.

If you're thinking about joining a project and have some very useful
information or questions you can contact me by email
(anthony.wong@columbia.edu). I'm open to reading, answering questions and
taking notes right at home.

My experience includes some amazing topics like computational engineering,
natural language processing, and machine learning technology, along with
numerous other courses on how we can better understand and apply that knowledge
to our complex projects.

If you're interested in joining a project, please be on the lookout for
articles on how to apply learning, and the resources that are available to you
online in one place.

You can find me online at: https://logan-lieou.github.io/AnthonyWong/

If you're not into programming but would like to participate in a project you
may apply here, including to work with other members of the University's
programming team. And please be sure to send all applications, to my contact
list, to all those available in-person.
