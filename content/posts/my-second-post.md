The plane, shot down in the east, was in its last flight to the Indian Ocean,
while the crew of the A320 plane at the controls were reportedly injured. The
accident was reported to have affected the whole flight.

There have been 4,800 high-definition video from the ground of the plane flying
over the area, which was hit by the Indian air traffic control as the airline
was approaching the runway on Friday morning.

The Indian Air traffic control says it is trying to make contact with the
ground in time to save the passengers of the aircraft that were on the flight.

Malaysian authorities released their first official word yet of the wreckage
Monday as they said they thought the fire was contained to a single aircraft.

The Malaysian air traffic control said that its team is currently trying to
ascertain the cause of the crash, as it did not believe it was a high-speed
collision. It said it has identified the injured in one of its images that have
now been analyzed.

Meanwhile, India has also announced that it would not participate in this
year's World Cup finals in Brazil, as part of the plan
