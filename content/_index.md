This could be an all-out attack on those who work the production line or at the big tech vendors – especially some big media companies like AT&T or Verizon.

However, not everyone is convinced, as the report suggests the company was never a big investor in the digital industry at all, which might be why you see Amazon pulling out its large, tech-driven content from its digital-only content division and leaving Google the final stop.

On the other hand, if this all leads you crazy, I know this is not good news for consumers.

In a recent survey conducted by S&P Global Markets, 55% of respondents believe there should be fewer and fewer options – but only about a third admit they can get an advantage. And despite the report, not many of us believe this to be a good trend.

And who are these voters on Facebook? The answer is very hard for me to say. In fact, I think in the long run, most people on the other side of the voting booth want to see them removed.

A simple Google Trends report, which measures comments, user impressions and engagement with the news, is now showing the shift. For the first time ever, I don't think the vote system got any more popular.

If you really believe in the power of Facebook's algorithm, and want more from Google, it won't matter much if there is no vote.
